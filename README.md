# LocalisationReplacer
Small python tool to help with non-English localisation: The english localisation will be set as the other languages', which will prevent the localisation keys from being seen

# How to use
Put the Python script in your root localisation folder (Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\mod\YOURMOD\localisation)

Run the script.

No need to create the other localisation files or folders, the script will do it by itself.

WARNING: The script will overwrite any already-existing file with the corresponding name, so if you already worked on non-english localisation it will probably be deleted once you launch the script.
